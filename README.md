> This is my first attempt at using the GIPHY API to make a dynamic website that populates gifs.

## Table of Contents
- gitf.js 
- index.html
- style.css
- reset.css

## General Info
This is a dynamic website that uses the GIPHY API to populate gifs and I am using JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.
I created an array of strings with an 'animals' theme  to display when first visiting the site. If you were to click on any 'animal' button
then the site will populate 10 gifs with the animal you chose. The gifs are at first all still and when you click on one it will begin to animate,
and if you click on it again the animation will stop. If you click on another animal button then the site will reste and populate a new set of 10
gifs that are relating to the new button you clicked. In the 'Add an animal or anything!' search bar you can search for any animal or any topic you can
think of and then a new button with the search you created will appear in the animals array. You can then click on the new button that you created and
populate 10 new gifs relating to the new button you just clicked and you can add more!
